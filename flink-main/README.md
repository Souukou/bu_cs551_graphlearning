# Wiki Edits

Discussion 02 - Wiki Edits. Create your first Flink application!

## Tasks to complete
Your own tasks will be to implement the `MyFilterFunction` and `MyMapFunction` within `src/main/java/org/apache/flink/quickstart/WikiEdits.java`. No other files should be changed or modified and the only code needed are the implementations for the two methods provided. There are TODO labels showing the desired outcome and what to do for each method.

Please use intelliJ for this lab as it will help you by providing the JDK, maven compiler and hints on how to complete the code. If you want to use VSCode or any other IDE make sure that maven and JDK are installed properly on your system.
